# Description of the project
This project is an ABC music file parser and analysis tool. It reads ABC notation files (a standard format for folk music notation), extracts tune information, stores it in a SQLite database, and provides an interactive interface for querying and analyzing the music data. The system can handle multiple "books" of tunes organized in folders.
# Instructions for use
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed
2. Install required packages: `pip install pandas`
3. Place your ABC files in the `abc_books` folder (with numbered subfolders 0, 1, 2, etc.)
4. Run the program: `python main.py`
5. Use the menu to:
   - Search tunes by title
   - Filter by book number
   - Filter by tune type (jig, reel, etc.)
   - View all tunes in the database

# How it works:
the program follows a three-step process:

1. File Parsing: Scans the `abc_books` directory, reads ABC files, and extracts metadata (title, type, key, meter) and notation from each tune.

2. Database Storage: Stores all parsed tunes in a SQLite database (`tunes.db`) with structured fields for easy querying.

3. Data Analysis: Uses pandas to load the database into a DataFrame and provides interactive query functions through a text menu.

Key features:
- Handles multiple tunes per ABC file
- Extracts ABC metadata (T: title, R: type, K: key, M: meter)
- Stores original ABC notation for reference
- Provides case-insensitive search capabilities
- Interactive menu for user queries

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
The program runs. It parses files, stores data in a database, and allows basic queries. It meets the technical requirements.


# What I learned

I learnt that ABC files can be parsed with Python and stored in SQLite. The assignment showed it's possible to create a basic data query system for music notation files.
I learnt how to use github properly.
